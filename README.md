Translator

## Description
### Web Client
The web client is based on the REACT library, with TypeScript used for development. React is a library developed by Facebook that simplifies complex processes in web interface development. TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, is also utilized, becoming increasingly standard in the industry.

In addition to React, the following libraries are used in the front-end project:

React Redux: Used for managing application state in a store.
React Redux Toolkit: Facilitates creating an interface for API requests and caching.
Mui (Material-UI): A comprehensive library of visual components.
Axios: Used for making HTTP requests.
The web client operates as follows:

When the user is not logged in, they can:
- Log in
- Register
- Perform anonymous translations

When the user is logged in, they can:
- Perform translations, which will be saved in a translation history
- View their translation history
- Add translations to favorites
- Log out

### Backend
The backend is a .NET API that takes the requests of both the web and Android clients. It was coded in C#. The backend uses the Azupre API AI Translator. This API was used to take care of doing the translation of the text that the backend received from the client, that would then be sent back to the client after it was translated. The backend also took care of authenticating users that wished to keep an history of their translations, and consequently manage this history for each users. A SQLite database was used to manage this.
